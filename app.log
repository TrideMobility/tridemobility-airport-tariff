Pickle files can be modified to deliver a malicious payload that results in execution of arbitrary code on your machine.You will need to set `allow_dangerous_deserialization` to `True` to enable deserialization. If you do this, make sure that you trust the source of the data. For example, if you are loading a file that you created, and know that no one else has modified the file, then this is safe to do. Do not set this to `True` if you are loading a file from an untrusted source (e.g., some random site on the internet.).
